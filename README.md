# Hamiltonian Path with Stops

This repository contains a project that analyzes the performance of different algorithms on solving variations of the Hamiltonian Path problem. The fitness criterion used in this study is the **shortest longest path** between the stop vertices.

## Overview

The **Hamiltonian Path problem** is a classic computational problem in graph theory, where the goal is to determine a path that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once. This project explores a variation of the problem where specific **stop vertices** are prioritized, and the objective is to minimize the length of the longest segment in the resulting path.

## Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Multiple algorithms for solving the Hamiltonian Path problem with stops.
  - Comparative analysis of their performance based on the "shortest longest path" criterion.

- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Benchmarks for each algorithm.
  - Visualization of results for better understanding.

## Languages and Tools

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **C++ (92.4%)**: Core implementations of the algorithms.
- **Python (7.6%)**: Data analysis, result visualization, and auxiliary scripts.
